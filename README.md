# Basic Tools for Machine/Deep Learning
* This repository contains implementation of basic needs while encountering the machine learning/deep learning problems.
* I made this repository for my own purpose so, thus will not contain all of the basic tools and pre-processing stuff. 
* It can so happen that some of the functions are already installed in some library of tensorflow, pytorch, sklearn , etc. So please do
  not hesistate to create an issue and mentioning the name and appropriate import for that library.
